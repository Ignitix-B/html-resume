<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My programming journey began like any good adventure—with a spark of curiosity and a few lines of code. I started with
   the basics, dabbling in HTML and CSS, and was instantly hooked by the way I could create something from nothing on a
    screen. As I delved deeper, I discovered the power of JavaScript and the flexibility it brought to web development.
     The satisfaction of debugging a tricky function or seeing my code come to life is unmatched. From there, I explored
      other technologies like Bootstrap for design, jQuery for interactivity, and eventually, React.js for building
       dynamic user interfaces. Along the way, I’ve also dipped my toes into backend development with Node.js and
        Express.js, realizing that understanding the full stack gives me a more comprehensive view of how the web works.

<p> My journey hasn’t been without challenges—there have been countless hours spent wrestling with bugs, and more than a
   few late nights pondering over algorithms. But each obstacle has only fueled my passion to learn more. Whether it’s
    working on a personal project, contributing to a group assignment, or just experimenting with new frameworks, I’m
    always excited to push my skills further. Programming isn’t just a skill for me; it’s a way of thinking, solving
     problems, and continuously evolving in this fast-paced digital world. As I continue to grow as a developer, I’m
      excited to see where this journey will take me next!</p>
